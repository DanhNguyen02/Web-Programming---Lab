                    On 17 October 2020, Maguire scored his first goal of the season, equalising in the 23rd minute in a 
                    league match against Newcastle United that eventually ended in a 4–1 away win. On 27 January 2021, 
                    he equalised in the 64th minute even though the match ended in a 2–1 home loss against his former club 
                    Sheffield United, which ended a 13-match unbeaten run since the team lost to Arsenal on 1 November 2020. 
                    When several teammates received racist threats following the loss, Maguire joined other past and present 
                    United players condemning the abuse.He played the full 90 minutes on 2 February in United's Premier League 
                    record-equalling 9–0 home win against Southampton.
                    On 25 April, he equalled Gary Pallister's club record for playing the most number of league games without 
                    being substituted, by playing the full 90 minutes for the 71st consecutive Premier League game, in a 
                    scoreless draw against Leeds United. However, he couldn't break the record, as he had to be substituted in 
                    the 72nd minute of the subsequent game on 9 May, a 3–1 home win over Aston Villa, owing to an ankle injury. 
                    On 26 May, Maguire missed the 2021 UEFA Europa League Final against Villarreal due to injury, in which 
                    United lost on penalties after a 1–1 draw.
